Makefile is creating weird PartyApp$1 and $2 .class files... not sure why, must be the way I dealt with interdependancy between PersonMover and PartyApp

Also, to run go to bin (not into package) and use java animationSkeletonCode.PartyApp <args>
(Only figured this out after like 20 minutes of angry shouting, even if it is kind of obvious)

Report is in docs

Have a good day, and enjoy the party
